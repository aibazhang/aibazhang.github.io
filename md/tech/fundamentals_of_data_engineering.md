# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

## Data Engineerng Described

- Data Engineering Lifecycle
  - Generation -> [Ingestion, Transformation, Serving, Storage] -> [Analytics, ML, Reverse ETL]
  - Undercurrents
    - Security
    - Data management
    - DataOps
    - Data architectur
    - Orchestration
    - Software engineering
- Data Engineering Skill and Activitities
  - DE Focused on
    - balancing the simplest and most cost-effective, best-of-breed, services that deliver value to the business
    - create agile data architectures that evolve as new trends emerge
  - DE dosen't do, but should have a good functioning understanding
    - build ML model
    - create reports or dashboards
    - perform data analysis
    - build KPIs
    - develop software applications
- Data Maturity
  - Starting with data
    - the company may have fuzzy, loosely defined goals or no goals
    - DE is usually generalist
    - jumping to ML without building a solid data fundation always get stuck
  - Scaling with data
    - the challenge is crating scalable data architectures
    - DE move from generalists to specialist
    - scaling is not only cluster nodes, storage, or technology but the data engineering team
  - Leading with data
    - The automated pipelines and systems created by DE allow people within the company to do self-service analystics
    - Creting automation for the seamless intruduction and usage of new data
    - Custom tolls -> competitive advantage
- Skill set
  - Busiiness Responsibilities
    - Know how to communicate with notechnical and technical people
    - Understand how to scope and gather business and product requirements
    - Understand the cultural fundations of Agile, DevOps, and DataOps
    - Control costs
    - Learn continuously
  - Technical Responsibilities
    - SQL, Python, Java/Scala, bash
    - develop proficency in secondary programming languages (Go, JavaScript, Rust)
    - Focus on the fundamentals to understand what'not going to change
    - pay attention to ongoing development to know where the field is going
- Type A & B DE
  - Type A
    - Stands for abstraction
    - DE lifecycle by using entirely off-the-shelf products, managed services and tools
    - across industries and at all levels of data maturity
  - Type B
    - Strands for build
    - stage 2 & 3 in maturity
    - initial data use case is unique and mission-critical that custom data tools are required to get started
